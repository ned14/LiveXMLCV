                    <p>I am a <b>SCHOLAR AND EDUCATOR</b> with an inter-disciplinary knowledge
                        spanning multiple numerate and non-numerate subjects, in many of which I
                        possess a formal academic qualification. My primary academic research
                        interest is in managing human civilisation under conditions of declining
                        basic resource inputs with a particular emphasis on the moral, social and
                        economic consequences therein.</p>
                    <p>I have experience in teaching at many diverse levels of academic difficulty,
                        student ability and class size, having approximately two hundred hours of
                        paid higher education teaching experience. I have lectured informally at
                        student societies and gatherings of enthusiasts as well as providing higher
                        education private tuition for students including those with learning
                        difficulties. One of my many experiences involved teaching Economics at
                        degree level at the National University of Ireland (NUI), Cork. As part of
                        this employment, I designed the curriculum and assessment rubrics, and I
                        achieved an excellent average 87.2% class attendance, an 82.8%
                        Interestingness and an 81.2% Clearness rating in the weekly feedback.
                        Another experience involved teaching Business to French undergraduates where
                        I deployed an experimental critical thinking skills curriculum based on
                        Springer and Borthick's 2004 paper, with great success. I have approximately
                        sixty hours of postgraduate tutoring employment in e-Business at NUI Cork,
                        and I have a deep understanding of other cultures through living and working
                        in the countries of Britain, Spain, Ireland and Canada, and in the languages
                        of English (native speaker) and Spanish in which I am conversationally
                        fluent.</p>

                    <p>I have over fifteen years of computer software engineering experience across
                        multiple projects, from large to small, from defence to health care. I have
                        acted as Chief Software Architect and Expert Consultant as well as Team
                        Member. Unusually for a Software Engineer, I hold an additional
                        undergraduate degree in Economics and Management, giving me a uniquely deep
                        perspective on generating Business Value.</p>
                    <p>I serve on various international engineering standardisation committees,
                        including ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 (Programming languages, their environments and
                        system software interfaces) and JTC1/SC38 (Distributed application platforms
                        and services). I am currently the JTC1/SC22 convenor for the Republic of Ireland.</p>

                    <p>I am a specialist in <b>SYSTEMS OPTIMISATION</b> with a particular aptitude
                        for eliciting solutions where there are no obvious avenues forward. I have
                        worked in the fields of computer hardware and software, academia, problem
                        solution, consultancy, design and military procurement. I have lived and
                        worked in the countries of Britain, Spain, Ireland and Canada, and in the
                        languages of English (native speaker) and Spanish in which I am
                        conversationally fluent. I have worked as a permanent employee, under
                        contract and as a freelancer and have helped others to steer projects large
                        and small to a successful and timely completion.</p>
                    <p>I have contributed over two and a half man-years of computer programming to
                        open source and my code is present in much of the world's telecommunications
                        infrastructure including the root DNS servers which are central to the
                        internet, the world's leading ERP solution used by hundreds of thousands of
                        companies worldwide, the branch ATM network of one of the world's largest
                        banks, the EuroFighter defence aircraft, the Micrium car operating system
                        used by many European and Japanese car manufacturers, the GNU Compiler
                        Collection, the Boost C++ libraries and one of the data analysis and
                        planning tools used by the US Department of Defence. I operate my own
                        geographically distributed information repository cloud based on the Plone
                        content and knowledge management system which allows interested people to
                        collaboratively work on a series of next generation repositories of
                        information useful to society. One of my largest commercial contributions
                        was to the support and maintenance systems of the EuroFighter defence
                        aircraft in which I was the chief software architect who designed its
                        bench-portable control software meeting strict military specifications.</p>
                    <p>In more recent years, and especially since 2008, I have spent an increasing
                        amount of time mentoring others, developing cutting edge algorithmic and
                        holistic system theory, and contributing towards international engineering
                        standards via the ISO process. The evidence of my many years and tens of
                        thousands of contributions of advice to open source project mailing lists
                        and fora is obvious from any search of Google for my name.</p>

                            Each of these was delivered via a critical approach making particular use
                            of annotated contemporary articles from the business press and audio-visual

                <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wrote an academic treatise on the topic of
                    user mode page allocation which stemmed from the work performed in the previous
                    two experiences. This paper presents a large number of empirical test results
                    comparing kernel page allocator performance on Microsoft Windows and Linux with
                    the user mode page allocator as implemented below in a wide variety of synthetic
                    and real world scenarios using the binary patching process injection feature of
                    nedmalloc. The paper has been submitted for presentation to the 2011 Federated
                    Computing Research Conference to be held in San Jose, U.S.A.</div>

                    implementing the user mode page allocator for nedmalloc (see last experience)
                    into a standalone C and C++ architecture independent library called
                        <em>nedtries</em>. This library implements an in-place bitwise Fredkin trie
                    algorithm which allows for near constant time insertions, deletions, finds,
                    closest fit finds and iteration as well as being of equal speed in each of these
                    operations (a very unusual characteristic in search algorithms). Benchmarking
                    shows it to be approximately 50-100% faster than red-black trees and up to 20%
                    faster than O(1) hash tables. Also added a C++ STL std::map&lt;&gt; and
                    std::unordered_map&lt;&gt; compatible container called
                    nedtries::trie_map&lt;&gt; which allows very easy usage from C++. Full

                    significantly improve the performance of one of their major projects for the US
                    Department of Defence, a planning solver application which constructs large
                    trees of interrelated objects occupying multiple gigabytes of RAM. Through the
                    benchmarking and analysis performed during the previous contract with ARA, we
                    realised that there ought to be a &gt; 10% performance improvement realisable
                    through implementing a user mode memory page allocator.

                    <ul>
                        <li>As part of the contract tendering process, a quick technology
                            demonstration was written to determine the potential performance
                            improvements. It was discovered that remapping memory pages via the
                            manipulation of the processor's memory management unit is around
                            twenty times faster than copying 4Kb of memory (on Intel Core 2) and
                            around sixty five times faster than copying 16Kb of memory. This meant
                            that large arrays of items could be extended several orders of
                            magnitude faster than is traditionally the case. These results were
                            sufficient to convince the customer to initiate the contract.</li>
                        <li>After implementation we found a further inadvertent cause of even
                            higher performance gains: the avoidance of having to clear newly
                            allocated memory. This allowed nedmalloc to run 20-25x faster when
                            manipulating allocations averaging 1Mb with exponentially larger gains
                            for larger allocations.</li>
                        <li>We later discovered an academic paper partially proposing a similar idea
                            entitled
                                <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1376892"><i>EVector:

                            however, and so superior are the performance benefits that an

                <ul>
                    <li>Determined that the source of their problems was that nedmalloc was not
                        being reliably called by their Qt-based application (a violation of the
                        ODR) which was causing segmentation faults. Many solutions were
                        analysed, and eventually a brute force approach of adding a binary
                        patcher was adopted which had the major long term cost advantage of not
                        requiring a custom build of Qt. This binary patcher replaced all usage
                        of the system allocator with usage of nedmalloc by rewriting the
                        appropriate parts of the PE format binaries on Windows.</li>
                    <li>One particular problem was handling system allocated blocks efficiently
                        as the logic for checking for such blocks is highly branch predictor
                        unfriendly. An initial 13% loss in performance on x86 was reduced to nil
                        through considerable hand tuning and analysis of assembler.</li>
                    <li>Even with the slight performance loss on x64, nedmalloc still remains the fastest free
                        portable memory allocator in the world, a title it has held since 2006.
                        It is now however much more flexible and useful than before especially
                        with respect to debugging facilities.</li>

                    &amp; Religious matters with a strong grounding in mathematical logic, based
                    on an application of the principles of the Tn project (below) to wider society.
                    After receiving feedback from others, I intend to expand this book into a series
                    of many books from 2009 onwards.</div>

                            significantly increasing speed and adding full compatibility with Linux

                    National Instruments’ technologies PXI, LabWindows/CVI, TestStand and LabView.
                    Also designed and implemented a system restore CD-ROM which was a bootable
                    version of Linux with custom-written software.</div>

            <detail><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
                        <li>The project’s goal was to be a bench-portable test bench control and
                            component management software plus bench-customisations for the (i)
                            M-3011 Hydraulic Test Bench Bench (contracted by EADS Deutschland) and
                            (ii) B-1057 Fuel Component Test Bench (contracted by British Aerospace
                            Systems) for the EuroFighter project.</li>
                        <li>Innovative features included:<ul>
                                <li>A self-adapting help system which taught the user as they used
                                    the bench. This was written in HTML with custom embedded ActiveX
                                    controls (MS HTMLHelp).</li>
                                <li>A graphical virtual instrument showing fuel flows, valve
                                    positions etc. which were manipulable using the mouse. This was
                                    implemented using a custom designed scripting language to
                                    specify possible fuel flows and possible valve states.</li>
                                <li>A searchable library of all engineering specifications in
                                    multiple formats including SGML, PDF and MS Word.</li>
                                <li>A completely customisable UUT test report generator (using
                                    Crystal Reports) which each air force could tailor
                                    individually.</li>
                                <li>The application could run on two computers connected by TCP/IP
                                    at the same time controlling the same bench.</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        <li>Due to the high performance &amp; safety requirements of testing
                            EuroFighter aircraft components, the code was written from the ground-up
                            to be efficient and with my own design of structured exception handling.
                            The Continuous Built-In Test (CBIT) was so accurate it detected hardware
                            problems no human could and required specialised equipment to
                            solve.</li>
                        <li>Performance analysis at the end of project using tools designed by
                            myself showed 5000 i/o's per second sustained (well above
                            specification).</li>
                        <li>The core was written in ANSI C but had ActiveX extensions support e.g. a
                            stopwatch &amp; timer (VisualBasic), report generator (Crystal
                            Reports, MFC &amp; Visual C++) and a voltmeter (LabView).</li>
                        <li>The database for the component (UUT) management was based in MySQL
                            manually linked against a disc based store of i/o transcripts and test
                            reports. Specialised support was present to suspend MySQL &amp;
                            compress its data store into a single file which then was burned
                            regularly to a backup CD.</li>
                        <li>Other responsibilities I assumed there included liasing extensively with
                            EADS, BAE and directly with the militaries of the four EuroFighter
                            participating nations.</li>
                        <li>While I implemented much of the core code myself (there was only myself
                            for the first six months), I also mentored &amp; led two other
                            programmers during my time there.</li>
